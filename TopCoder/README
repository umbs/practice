Started a README (and Journal) for my work on TC problems. Not always possible
to code daily as some learning is also involved. Want to journal it here and
commit.

Decided to start coding in C++, using STL and stuff. It's much
closer to C, my main programming language. Also noticed that C++ solutions on TC
is much concise, completed (generally) faster.
