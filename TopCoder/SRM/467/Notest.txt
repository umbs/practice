ShorterSuperSum:
- Some reason, using a matrix to save already calculated sum of (k, n)
  isn't working. 
- Having totalSum as follows is also not working: 

       for (i=1; i<=n; i++) 
           totalSum += calculate(k-1, i); 
       
       Instead, calculating totalSum at terminating condition worked. Why
       is this so? 

       if (k==0) {
           totalSum += n; 
           return n; 
       } 

- Interesting Properties: 
  f(k, n) = f(k-1, n) + f(k, n-1) // In a 2x2 matrix, this is sum of left
  and top elements. This can be used in DP.  

- Running Time? 
  - For f(1, n), f() is called n times. 
  - For f(2, n), f() is called
